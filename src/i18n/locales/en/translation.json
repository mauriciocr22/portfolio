  "aboutText": "I'm a Brazilian developer with a deep passion for coding, and most of what I know comes from rolling up my sleeves and diving into projects. I'm currently enrolled in an Internet Systems course at FATEC Rubens Lara, but I've spent a lot of time teaching myself the ins and outs of web development, especially with React, TailwindCSS, and Node.js. I love creating sleek, functional web apps and am always eager to learn more and tackle new challenges in the tech world. If youâ€™d like to learn more about me, feel free to reach out or download my resume!",
